  Block Explorer Link: https://etherscan.io/address/0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D#code
  
  Function Code:
     function _callTokens(address token, address spender, uint value) internal {
      (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.approve.selector, spender, value));
      require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), 'UniswapV2Router: APPROVE_FAILED');
      }
      
  Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method: abi.encodeWithSelector, abi.decode, call

Explanation

  Purpose: The _callTokens function is used to approve a spender to transfer a specified amount of tokens on behalf of the caller.
  
  Detailed Usage: The function uses abi.encodeWithSelector to create a message that calls the approve function on the token contract, passing in the spender and value parameters. It then uses the call 
  function to execute the message and transfer the approval. The response data is decoded using abi.decode to ensure the transaction was successful.
  
  Impact: The _callTokens function is essential for enabling the Uniswap router to transfer tokens on behalf of users, allowing for seamless trading and other operations in the protocol. The use of 
  abi.encodeWithSelector, call, and abi.decode ensures that the approval process is properly executed and verified.
